# Color Buddy
### nwHacks HackCamp 2023 Project

### Abstract
Our extension aims to address concerns about colorblind accessibility on the web

### The Problem
- Despite rise in prevalence of colorblind filters in video games, the support for color blind people on other side of the internet (practical, less entertainment oriented) is much more neglected in comparison.
- Reading multiple lines and data points on a graph/chart (i.e. commerce, stock, statistics), or tracing circuit paths (i.e. electrical engineering, network graphs, etc) with similar color scheme is difficult for chromatically impaired individuals. 
- Color blind artists or designers can face hardships in identifying certain colors and/or palettes used for reference found in the web. 

These difficulties can be faced the mostly on the web, as we obtain the majority of our information through our browsers. However, currently  the support for color-blindness on the general open web is far more undeveloped compared to support in video games. 

### Our Solution
- We created a Google Chrome extension for people affected with color blindness
  - Our extension allows the user to hover over elements, dynamically changing the color values and displaying the current color of the pixel the cursor is on.
  - Not only does it display a generalized color, it also displays the RGB values of the colors, allowing professional designers who may be affected from color blindness to access the color’s information as well.
- Okay, now colorblind people can differentiate colors on the web, so what?
  - Many fields of study such as economics, data science, bioinformatics, and many more rely heavily on graphs and visualizations to convey information. Visualizations are oftentimes colored, and not with a colorblind friendly palette in mind.
  - People argue that colorblind people cannot be great creators because they don’t see the full spectrum of colors. However, we believe that colorblind afflicted designers or artists can create even more intriguing and eye-catching art, because they can see things from a different perspective.
